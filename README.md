# Dynamic-Function-Scheduling-in-Multi-tenant-Serverless-Environments
The project optimizes resource utilization and performance in serverless VM clusters using GNNs for availability prediction, enabling time-aware analysis, dynamic patterns, and scalable resource management.
# Overview
In cloud computing environments, managing resources dynamically and efficiently is critical for performance and cost optimization. This project explores a serverless architecture with a focus on:

Time-aware Analysis: Identifying optimal times for resource allocation and scaling based on real-time data.

Community Discovery: Detecting patterns within the virtual machine cluster for better load balancing and resource sharing.

Dynamic Pattern Identification: Using advanced graph representation and dependency modeling to improve prediction accuracy for availability and performance.

By utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we predict the availability of resources in a cloud environment, enabling better resource allocation, reducing latency, and improving overall system efficiency.
